### Reasons to Automate Vs Manually :
 

- Was only a small set of data so easy just to do quickly
- while finding an automating solution on google, found no point in using if I couldnt understand it
- automate what can be tedious and repated to make things flow faster, like counting the letters in one long string can be done with commands


#### to show the letters count in a file
> wc -m filenName.txt 

#### to display the letters from a specified range in a file 
> cut -c 1-24 fileName.txt
